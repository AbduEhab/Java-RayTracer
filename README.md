# Overview

This is the first Ray-Tracer I have ever written. It does not support any fancy features like Global Illumination.

Fully supports Windows (full UI and stuff) - NOW SUPPORTS GCC (tested on windows only). Linux works in `Legacy mode` which would output the rendered image onto the terminal, macOS was not tested.

# Requirements
- [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

## Getting Started
Just run the main file and you're good to go!
